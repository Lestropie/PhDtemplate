\chapter*{Preface}
%
The main use of the Preface is if, like me, you include journal articles that are published / accepted for publication as thesis chapters. If you choose to do this (which I highly recommend), then here you will need to give the necessary details. For instance: which chapters are reproduced from journal articles, and which are written specifically for the thesis; reference details for published articles; details of co-author contributions. Make sure you read the relevant university policy.
