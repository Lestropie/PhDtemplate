% Here you can define custom LaTex commands; I'm not an expert so I can't comment on the
% power of commands, but there's some simple examples here that may be of use.
%
% Some of these use the \ensuremath command; basically this allows the command to be used either
% inside or outside a math environment, without spitting cryptic compiler errors at you.
%
% For the math commands, LaTeX can be abit funny about including a whitespace afterwards. So
% some of these commands have two versions, with one explicitly including a space afterwards.
%
\newcommand{\sq}    {\ensuremath{^2~}}
\newcommand{\sqs}   {\ensuremath{^2}}
\newcommand{\cb}    {\ensuremath{^3~}}
\newcommand{\cbs}   {\ensuremath{^3}}
\newcommand{\x}     {\ensuremath{\times}}
\newcommand{\degr}  {\ensuremath{^\circ}~}
\newcommand{\degrs} {\ensuremath{^\circ}}
\newcommand{\prox}  {$\approx$}
\newcommand{\degc}  {$^{\circ}$C~}
\newcommand{\degcs} {$^{\circ}$C}

% This command inserts a pair of completely blank pages (i.e. they don't even contain page numbers)
% Personally I inserted these between each chapter; it ensures that for the first page of each
% chapter (which always occurs on an odd / RHS page), the corresponding LHS page is always blank.
\newcommand{\blankdoublepage}{
\newpage
\thispagestyle{empty}
\null
\newpage
\thispagestyle{empty}
