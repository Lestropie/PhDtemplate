## PhD thesis LaTeX template

This is a LaTeX template that I produced following submission of my PhD thesis back in 2009. I took my completed thesis, stripped out almost all of the actual content, used the remaining snippets of content to produce worked examples of LaTeX features (along with explanations of how to modify them to satisfy one's own needs), and added text to explain to novice users the benefits of using LaTeX for thesis generation and how to get started.

The instructions for use of the template are contained in file "`thesis.pdf`" (actual instructional content begins at page 33). Once appropriate software setup has been performed (for which some options are described in the document), re-compilation of the provided source files should result in re-generation of this PDF file.

From there, the user is responsible for filling the source files with their own content.

Hope it proves useful.
