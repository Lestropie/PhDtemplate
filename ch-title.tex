% This is the title page of the thesis
% When submitting the thesis for examination, if you get it printed and bound
% by the GSA, the thermal binding has a transparent sheet over the front page.
% Therefore the title page should be the first page of the printed document, so
% that it is visible through the transparent cover.
%
% I have used my front cover as the basis, so you can see where everything goes and
% how you may want to space everything. UoM doesn't specify exactly how the
% title page should appear; note however that the university stipulates that
% the university logo must NOT appear in the thesis AT ANY POINT.
